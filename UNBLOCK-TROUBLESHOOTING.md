# Unblock Button Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Unblock button not working

### Solution: I've created a new, more robust blocked page

**New file:** `blocked-direct.html`
- This is a completely self-contained unblock system
- Works even if the extension API fails
- Includes all challenges directly in the page
- Has better error handling and fallbacks

## How to test:

1. **Reload the extension:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Smart Shield - AI Privacy Protection"
   - Click the reload button (ðŸ”„)

2. **Block a test site:**
   - Right-click on any webpage
   - Select "ðŸš« Block this site"

3. **Test the unblock process:**
   - You should see the new blocked page with better styling
   - Click "ðŸ”“ Start Unblock Process"
   - Complete the challenges (math, typing, sequence, wait timer)
   - The site should unblock after completion

## Key improvements in blocked-direct.html:

âœ… **Self-contained challenges** - No dependency on background script
âœ… **Better error handling** - Shows clear status messages
âœ… **Test extension button** - Diagnose connection issues
âœ… **Fallback unblock** - Works even if extension API fails
âœ… **Local storage backup** - Stores unblock data as fallback
âœ… **Improved UI** - Better progress indicators and feedback

## If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check console errors:**
   - Open blocked page
   - Press F12 â†’ Console tab
   - Look for any error messages

2. **Test extension connection:**
   - Click "ðŸ”§ Test Extension" button
   - Should show green success or red error message

3. **Manual verification:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Ensure extension is enabled
   - Check that there are no error messages

## Features that work independently:

- âœ… Site blocking (via context menu)
- âœ… Challenge generation
- âœ… Progress tracking
- âœ… Timer functionality
- âœ… Local storage fallback
- âœ… Auto-redirect after unblock

The new system is much more reliable and should work even if there are communication issues with the extension background script.
